# Infrastructure Layer

Following the Clean architecture, this layer is only (or should be) dependent on the Application and oblivious to any other layer.

The layer should contain the implemtation of the interfaces presented by the application layer.

However you wish to structure this folder is up to you

In this case, the folders in this layer contains:

## Extensions

Contains neccessary code to help integrate into any presentation layer or startup/program class.

## Implemtation

Contains the implemtation of the Application interfaces
