## Presentation Layer

This is the application that runs and communicates with the user. It depends on the Application Layer but configure all the layers properly. This may differ a liitle for other presentation layer (such as using a console application) but it should not be much of a hassle.

This application uses react as the front-end framework which is found in the ClientApp

Migrations are found here - (I hope to move it to the Persistence layer) any Idea would be appreciated

For using the front-end framework, simple uncomment the code with the comment "For front-end framework" at the top in the Start-up class
